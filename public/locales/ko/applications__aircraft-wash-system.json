    "p4": "THE INTERCLEAN CLEAR WASH RINSE SYSTEM MEETS US MILITARY SPECIFICATIONS FOR FUNCTIONALITY",
    "p5": "Our Clear Water Rinse System (CWRS) is a high volume, low pressure washing system in which approximately 80% of the water used during the rinse process is collected and recycled. To assure efficient rinsing, the water being recycled is continually monitored for salinity and other contaminants (Total Dissolved Solids). Once the TDS reaches a specified level the water is discharged to the sanitary sewer or water storage tank for disposal and fresh water is used to recharge the system. This system was designed specifically to meet the aircraft wash needs of the US Navy.",
    "p6": "Because of the corrosive nature of sea water, the US Navy has established a requirement to wash all aircraft within a 300 mile radius of sea water or for aircraft flying below 3000’ over sea water. If you are looking for a custom designed, US made airplane wash system that meets military specs, call +1 (734) 822-7815 for a quote.",
