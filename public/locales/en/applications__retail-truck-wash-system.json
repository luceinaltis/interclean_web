    "p1": "DRIVE THROUGH SYSTEM",
    "p2": "The InterClean commercial truck wash systems are the most advanced wash systems in the world. Fully automated commercial truck wash systems designed by InterClean can produce 15 to 30 clean trucks per hour with only one employee.",
    "p3": "This commercial truck wash design allows the system to operate continuously using recycled water — even while the settling pits are being emptied and cleaned. The pits are emptied of liquids automatically while the dried sludge is removed by the use of a Bobcat and roll-off containers.",
    "p4": "InterClean does not design and build wash systems that use deadly hydrofluoric acid in any part of cleaning. InterClean opposes the use of hydrofluoric acid in any form in vehicle washing.",

    "p5": "GANTRY / ROLLOVER DESIGN – ULTIMA",
    "p6": "The Ultima, our specially designed Gantry/Rollover Design require a smaller footprint and are available with multiple options such as touchless, friction or a combination of both.",

    "p7": "ULTIMATE CLEANING POWER FOR A VARIETY OF TRUCKS",
    "p8": "The newly designed Ultima Fleet Washer presents state-of-the-art technology for the large vehicle cleaning industry and fulfils extensive needs in a variety of applications. The top models combine advanced brushless and brush wash methods and clean all kinds of vehicles from small trucks to complex shaped tractors and trailers.",
    "p9": "TOP CLASS CLEANING POWER FOR HARD-TO-CLEAN VEHICLES",
    "p10": "The Rainbow Ultima is equipped with a prewash and high-pressure systems consisting of oscillating and profiling solid stream nozzle assemblies that have the best available cleaning power for tanker trucks, garbage trucks and other hard-to-clean odd shaped vehicles. For standard applications the Ultima can be equipped with conventional high-pressure nozzles.",

    "p11": "THE KEY CLEANING ADVANTAGE – HIGH PRESSURE WASHING",
    "p12": "Transportation vehicles have a large number of areas beyond the reach of brushes. Therefore it is important to note that the high-pressure washing features in this system play a major role in the cleaning processes. Additionally, the high-pressure water jets remove sand and other coarse particles, which could potentially scratch finishes of vehicles during the brush stage of the wash. The Ultima high pressure arch’s use both the conventional flat spray and advanced solid stream pattern for the maximum cleaning impact and efficient washing.",

    "p13": "TRIPLE COVERAGE SWEEPING TECHNIQUE FOR ENHANCED CLEANING",
    "p14": "Vertically sweeping side jets clean the sides from sills to roof. For enhanced cleaning, they oscillate up and down so that they overlap each other. Similarly, the high-pressure water jets on the rotary head oscillate sideways. High-pressure water jets, from nozzles situated in the rotary head, clean the vertical and horizontal surfaces from bumper to bumper. Rotational motions of the head, together with the lateral oscillating pattern, direct the far-reaching water jets into vehicle recesses that are beyond the reach of brushes.",
