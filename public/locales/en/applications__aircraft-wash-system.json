    "p3": "InterClean uses the latest technology to design systems that automate the wash and water recycling processes for aircraft wash systems. Our custom airplane washes use high-pressure nozzles to ensure a thorough clean, and a safe, efficient, operation wash after wash. Our touchless manual and automatic airplane wash systems are made in the USA and are installed and maintained by our local InterClean distributors. Contact us today for specs and pricing on a custom aircraft wash system.",

    "p4": "THE INTERCLEAN CLEAR WASH RINSE SYSTEM MEETS US MILITARY SPECIFICATIONS FOR FUNCTIONALITY",
    "p5": "Our Clear Water Rinse System (CWRS) is a high volume, low pressure washing system in which approximately 80% of the water used during the rinse process is collected and recycled. To assure efficient rinsing, the water being recycled is continually monitored for salinity and other contaminants (Total Dissolved Solids). Once the TDS reaches a specified level the water is discharged to the sanitary sewer or water storage tank for disposal and fresh water is used to recharge the system. This system was designed specifically to meet the aircraft wash needs of the US Navy.",
    "p6": "Because of the corrosive nature of sea water, the US Navy has established a requirement to wash all aircraft within a 300 mile radius of sea water or for aircraft flying below 3000â€™ over sea water. If you are looking for a custom designed, US made airplane wash system that meets military specs, call +1 (734) 822-7815 for a quote.",

    "p7": "REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE FOR INTERCLEAN AIRCRAFT WASH SYSTEMS",
    "p8": "The InterClean airplane wash systems are designed by an experienced team of engineers and guaranteed to meet your needs and specifications. However, both manual and automatic airplane wash systems need regular service and maintenance to continue to operate at peak performance.
